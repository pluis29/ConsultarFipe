## Introduction

This application allows you to query the Tabela Fipe through the  [FIPE API](https://deividfortuna.github.io/fipe/?ref=public_apis) provided by Deivid Fortuna. Users can specifically search for their vehicle, obtain the corresponding information, and choose to favorite the search result.

- This project was developed as part of the [#7DaysOfCode](https://7daysofcode.io/matricula/windows-forms) challenge, which aims to build a desktop application using **Windows Forms** and consuming a Rest API with **C#**.
